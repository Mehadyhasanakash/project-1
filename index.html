            <p class="text-aline">For many years I’ve had the we to visit nursing homes as
                I truly enjoy spending time with the elderly. I sing and teach Bible
                studies and appreciate hearing about their former lives. The Lord has
                allowed me to make some precious friendships and I want to share with you about a
                lovely lady who after a devastating stroke was no longer able to be independent and is
                now in a comfortable setting where she is well taken care of</p>

                This autobiographical case study reflects upon how a senior academic leader repurposed the Learning without Limits
                pedagogical framework originally developed within UK primary and secondary school settings to inform the development of
                a new transformational leadership framework within a higher education setting. Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle is used
                to structure an analytically self-reflective account of the leadership behaviours deployed for a distributed model of academic
                development to be effective, viewed through the lens of Learning without Limits. As a result, a new framework to inform
                effective approaches to the leadership of change in higher education is suggested: Leading without Limits.</p>

                Social media has emerged as one of the most powerful tools for communication and connection, bringing together millions of people across continents and within communities. But with that power, highly accessible channels are readily available for spreading disinformation, sowing divisiveness and contributing to offline conflict. In Sri Lanka, there has never been a more urgent need for healthy media consumption and digital and media literacy for youth.</p>

            <h2>BANGLADESH VS NEW ZEALAND</h2> <br>
            <h3>Former volleyball star Ebadot Hossain seals famous Bangladesh win in New Zealand</h3><br>
            <p>With a gentle drive through the off side for four, Mushfiqur Rahim steered Bangladesh to possibly the greatest upset in Test match history by beating New Zealand in their own backyard by eight wickets.

                This was not supposed to happen. New Zealand, the World Test champions and No 1-ranked team, were undefeated in 17 Tests at home, winning the past six. They have won their past eight home series and although they were missing Kane Williamson, the captain, with an elbow injury, they were able to pick their strongest available XI.
                
                Bangladesh, on the other hand, were without two of their best players in Tamim Iqbal and Shakib Al Hasan and had not won a match in any format in the 32 times they have played in New Zealand in the past 21 years.
                
                They arrived fresh from being hammered 2-0 at home by Pakistan, who managed to win the second match despite 2½ days being lost to rain. Expectations, therefore, that Bangladesh could be competitive — let alone win their sixth Test in 61 games overseas — against such a strong New Zealand side were about as low as they could be.
                
                However, there is a spirit to this Bangladesh side and one that was best encapsulated by the performance of Ebadot Hossain. It was the 27-year-old seamer’s six for 46 in only his 11th Test that helped to skittle out New Zealand for 169 to leave his side with a target of 41 that they patiently knocked off in Mount Maunganui.</p>
